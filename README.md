# Roy Sublime Text 2 package.

## Inspiration

This is greatly inspired by [@surjikal][surjikal]'s [Coffee Compile][coffee-compile] and my own [LiveScript][sublime-livescript] package.

## Features

* Syntax highlighting
* Transpilation to js

## Usage

Compile the entire file by not selecting any text (or all the text).
Compile a section by selecting just that section.
Keyboard shortcut `alt-shift-r`
Command Pallette integration `Roy`
Context menu `right click`

## Install

### Package Control

Now available in [@wbond][wbond]'s [package control][package-control].  Just bring up the package control menu in sublime (default `ctrl-shift-p`), and enter `Package Control: Install Package`, search for `Roy`.
